# Eunomia.NET

Eunomia.NET is a cross-platform implementation of [JSR 94](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=94)
for the CLR/.NET, and written in C#.

## Architecture

There may be more than a few instances where there are abstractions in the reference implementation
that can be expressed in more idiomatic C# compared to the reference's Java style.  Where it makes sense,
I am introducing said idiomatic changes while keeping the interfaces as close to the reference implementation
as possible.
 
## Who is Eunomia?
 
Eunomia is the name of an ancient Greek goddess that presided over laws, rulings, and governance.
